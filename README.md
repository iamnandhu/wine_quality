# Modelling wine quality based on its physicochemical properties using random forest classifier and Scikit-learn.

# Data:

There are two datasets related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.
In this project we only use red wine dataset.   
Datasets are available at: [UCI ML repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php/) and [Paulo Cortez's web page](http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/wine/).
In `wine_project.ipynb` , we will download the datasets using python.
